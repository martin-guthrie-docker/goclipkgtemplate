# goclipkgtemplate
A template for starting a Go CLI/PKG tool with nice(er) logging and unit test.

Go dependancies
* "github.com/spf13/cobra"
* "github.com/sirupsen/logrus"
* "github.com/onrik/logrus/filename"
* "github.com/x-cray/logrus-prefixed-formatter"

The motivation is to create a sample directory structure and naming format for \
creating a CLI tool that can also be used as a package (pkg).
